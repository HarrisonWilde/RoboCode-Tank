Extract the files and open a terminal in the folder they were extracted to.

Run 'java -jar robocode-1.9.2.4-setup.jar'. Follow the instructions.

A sample robot is provided in the uXXXXXXX folder.
Rename this folder to u<YourUniNumber>.
Similarly rename the package the robot is part of.

Your final submission should consist of a zip containing only your .java files (and any supplementary files needed) in the correct folder structure. The top-level package name should be as above.
Note that IDEs such as Eclipse will not do this for you, you will need to zip up the files as requested manually.
